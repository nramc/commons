## Overview

The **Commons** Project is a Java-based library designed to provide a collection of reusable libraries and
utilities that can be easily integrated into various software projects. Inspired by the well-established Apache
Commons project, this repository aims to offer a modular approach to solving common programming challenges, allowing
developers to reuse and share code efficiently across different projects.

Similar to **Apache Commons**, this project is driven by the philosophy of code reuse and modularity, helping developers
avoid reinventing the wheel. By focusing on individual, well-defined modules, it provides the flexibility to choose only
the components you need while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

At its core, this project leverages the power of multi-module Maven projects to ensure that each module is independently
built, tested, and maintained. By structuring the project in this way, it is possible to isolate concerns, improve
scalability, and add functionality in a plug-and-play fashion. This is especially useful for large applications that
require multiple independent components working together seamlessly.

## Modules

### GeoJSON

The [GeoJSON module](geojson/README.md) provides domain models which complains with
[rfc7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946) to parse, create, and manipulate GeoJSON objects, which are
commonly used for representing geographical data. The module is designed to be flexible and performant, making it
suitable for use in a
wide variety of applications.
